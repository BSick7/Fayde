UIElement:
	- RenderTransform				--> 2d transform applied to UIElement only during render.  Size/Bounds will be unaffected.
	- RenderTransformOrigin			--> [0.0, 1.0]	--> Multiplied by size of element to get local coordinates origin

	- _Extents						--> (0, 0, ActualWidth, ActualHeight);
	- _Bounds						--> extents -> grow by effect padding	-> Transform by 2d absolute xform
	- _GlobalBounds					--> extents -> grow by effect padding	-> Transform by 3d local projection
	- _SurfaceBounds				--> extents	-> grow by effect padding	-> Transform by 3d absolute projection

FrameworkElement:
	- _ExtentsWithChildren			--> union all child global bounds
	- _BoundsWithChildren
	- _GlobalBoundsWithChildren
	- _SurfaceBoundsWithChildren	
	- UpdateLayout					--> Continually runs layout passes until measure/arrange/size are stabilized
