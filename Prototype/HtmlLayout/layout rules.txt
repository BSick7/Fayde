1. To make an element take up 100% of its given width and height use:
position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%;

2. Stretch overrules MaxWidth, MaxHeight

3. Height, Width turns off Stretch, item plus margin is centered and then even margin added to each side
set width/height of outer = intended width/height plus margins, set inner width/height = intended width/height
