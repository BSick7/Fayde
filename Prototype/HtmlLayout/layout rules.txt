1. To make an element take up 100% of its given width and height use:
position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%;

2. Stretch overrules MaxWidth, MaxHeight

3. Height, Width turns off Stretch, item plus margin is centered and then even margin added to each side
set width/height of outer = intended width/height plus margins, set inner width/height = intended width/height

4. If the parent has a set size, position should be absolute
   If the parent is looking to the child to provide size, position should be relative

5. If relative positioning, use margin on root
   If absolute positioning, use padding on sub
